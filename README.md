# Learning Journal ðŸ““

Each lecture day of the IHCC CIS 114 Introduction to AI you will add to this learning Journal. 
The idea of this journal is that by document your learning you will get more out of this class. 
Each day document your learning during the lecture. 

## "Giting" Set Up

Before getting started you will need a few accounts and software.
If you have developed software before, most of this you can skip.

- Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) downloaded to your local computer.
- If you don't already have one make a [GitHub](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) account make one (don't use school email).
- You will need an IDE (coding text editor). If you don't have one I recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Markdown

This Journal should be written in Markdown. 
Don't worry if you have never used Markdown its easy. 
[Here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) is a simple guide about markdown. 
or look at the example below. 

## Journal Examplec

Your journal can take many shapes.
Everyone's brain is different. 
Do what makes the most sense to **YOU**. 
But there are guidelines and a MVP.
For digrams, you can use anything. 
I recommend: 

- [Mermaid](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/): you can write them right into your journal. 
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/): **MAKE SURE TO EXPORT AND LINK THE IMAGE IN YOUR JOURNAL**. Link it as a image in your markdown.

While this journal is yours to personalize there some guidelines. 
I will mostly be grading based on effort.
